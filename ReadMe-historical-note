The following is only historical and for personal use:

This is my own documentation to help with building/testing/running/packaging kojo.
Original goal was to localize it for Turkish speaking folks. So, there is also
some doc on how the localization is to be done..

To compile/package and run kojo, do:

1- % build

That's an alias that sources: /Users/ben/src/kojo/git/packageAndRun.sh
See ./log/packageAndRun.log
After kojo starts, switch to Turkish, quit and restart it doing:

2- % kojo

You'll see the flash screen with "YÃ¼kleniyor..."

That's it.
